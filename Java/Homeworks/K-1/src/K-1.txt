Homework K-1
This is my own work

Example output:
    first sequence: {1, 4, 7, 10, 13, 16, 19, 22, 25, 28, 31, 34}
    second sequence: {5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50}
    Is there anything in common?
    The first in common is 10. It is the 4th number in the first sequence and is the 2nd number in the second sequence.
